HOW THINGS WENT PARAGRAPH:
For the most part, this project went well and there were only a few parts where I ran into significant trouble. 
It was extremely interesting to learn how the backend of LLMs work because before running through this code-along, 
I had no clue how most LLMs functioned under the hood. In part 2, I had a bit of difficulty with trying to find 
2 different LLMs to answer my user-generated questions, but eventually I was able to figure it out. I also had 
trouble with using curl to send API requests throughout all parts of the project because there were many instances 
where I had to look up syntax for what exactly needed to be included in my API requests. Overall, the project went 
seamlessly for me and it was a great learning experience, especially within the context of a class centered on 
conversational AI.
