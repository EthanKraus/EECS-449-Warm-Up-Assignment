QUESTION 1:
The new enum ChatType that we created is to represent when our ChatBot is in a prohibited state. A prohibited state
is defined as a state in which the dialogue prompt that the ChatBot has received would elicit the user with 
an answer regarding illegal or prohibited activities according to US law. The prohibited state can be used within 
our ChatBot when the question asked by the user regards illegal activities and the ChatBot is unable to give 
an appropriate response, so the ChatBot then enter a prohibited ChatType state. Examples of topics that would 
force the ChatBot to enter the prohibitied state would include, but are not limited to:
- weapons
- crime
- advice on other illegal activities, etc.

QUESTION 2:
Based on the classify() function, our ChatBot will look at our user's questions and then categorize the query into one
of 3 categories: either RAG, QA, or PROHIBITED. This classify() function looks at the query and if it believes
the question is relating to illegal activities (i.e. keywords like "drugs", "hack", "crime", etc.) then it will
subsequently route the ChatBot to our newly created ChatType of PROHIBITED. This will then force the ChatBot into our
PROHIBITED ChatType state and it will be forced to respond with an answer saying that it is not allowed to answer
questions relating to illegal activity.
